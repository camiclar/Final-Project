# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2021

## Theme
Every Death Counts
We took this quite literally. The goal is to score as many points as possible as coins don't respond once you die.

## Game Play
Your goal is to score as many coins as possible without dying. Once you die, your score goes back to zero and coins don't respond. Every death counts!
Use WASD to move your character. W is jump, A moves left, S bends down, D moves to the right.
