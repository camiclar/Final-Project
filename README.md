## Every Death Counts
We took this quite literally. The goal is to score as many points as possible as coins don't respond once you die.

## Game Play
Your goal is to score as many coins as possible without dying. Once you die, your score goes back to zero and coins don't respond. Every death counts!
Use WASD to move your character. W is jump, A moves left, S bends down, D moves to the right. 

## Impediments
There happened to be a few struggles that we came across when building our 2D Platformer. Some of those included making sure the enemies and coins would work properly with the player and to ensure the score/death count showed.
